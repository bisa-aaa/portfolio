Submerged was a 10-day children summmer camp held in 2016 by Edmonton Chinese Baptist Church in August. Following the theme, I paired some wave and bubble illustrations with the fish illustrations provided by Lifeway. The posters and brochures were distributed across the city of Edmonton to attract and inform parents of the day camp.
