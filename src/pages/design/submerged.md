Submerged is a 10-day children's summmer camp held annually by Edmonton Chinese Baptist Church in August. The 2016 for the vacation bible school day camp was 'Submerged'. Following the theme, I paired some wave and bubble illustrations with the fish illustrations provided by Lifeway. The posters and brochures were distributed across the city of Edmonton to attract and inform parents of the day camp.
