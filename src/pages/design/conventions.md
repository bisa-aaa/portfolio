The Rural Municipalities of Alberta (RMA) holds two conventions each year: Spring and Fall at the Edmonton Convention Centre. The featured conventions are from 2023.

At each convention, members have the opportunity to network and share ideas with other attendees, participate in workshops and sessions, vote for resolutions, stay up-to-date at the AGM, and share insights and voice concerns with ministers during the ministeral forum. The fall convention also has a tradeshow in partnership with the Canoe Procurement Group of Canada.

The branded design deliverables for an RMA convention consists of: letterhead, a sponsorship form, app graphics, nametags, handbook, workshop and sponsor signage, presentations, motion graphics for digital screens, and any additional designs that may be required. During 2023, the <a href="/design/uniquely-rural/" target="_blank">
Uniquely Rural</a> campaign was also featured at the convention.

During conventions, my responsibilities include photography and videoography coverage for the post-convention highlights and documentation.

RMA conventions require extensive preparations that begin months in advance, clear communication with other departments, and working with the convention coordinator.
