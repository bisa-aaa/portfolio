The Canadian Multicultural Education Foundation (CMEF) is a non-profit organization that promotes public awareness for multiculturalism and diversity.

This CMEF campaign brought attention to Canadian retirees' achievement and the value they bring to society and the need to not forget their contributions.

The campaign deliverables included a series of posters in six different languages (English, French, Chinese, Spanish, Punjabi. and Arabic), social media images, an LRT ad (Churchill station), and a banner for the launch event.
