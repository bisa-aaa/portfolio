The Rural Municipality of Alberta (RMA) recognized the need to share its members' unique perspective through videos and additional information shared on the RMA website.

The Uniquely Rural campaign began in July 2022 as an initiative to help a wider audience understand the rural point of view on specific topics and positions. This project helped amplify the voices of rural Alberta leading up to the the 2023 provincial election.

The <a href="https://rmalberta.com/uniquely-rural/" target="_blank">Uniquely Rural RMA Provincial Election Platform page</a> was created as a hub to direct viewers to the individual pages that delve deeper into the topics and house the candidate and platform guides as well.

The Uniquely Campaign leveraged the 2023 Spring Convention to maximize exposure and showcase the campaign to RMA members. An illustrated Uniquely Rural sign was distributed to the convention attendees.

After the election, due to its success, the Uniquely Rural campaign continued on as rural members were keen to share their stories and successes.

All of the videos are available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPQZuP3ArX4&list=PLOwQD01wk7sBxRzpIZyuE3VpcllpzEKDh" target="_blank">Uniquely Rural playlist</a> on the RMA's YouTube channel.

The campaign was a group effort that included contributions from the Advocacy team at the RMA, Hilary Darrah (Digital Communications Coordinator), and Brandon Low (Manager of Marketing Communications).
