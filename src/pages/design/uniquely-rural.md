The Rural Municipality of Alberta (RMA) recognized the need to share its members' unique perspective and members' voices through the Uniquely Rural campaign that began in July 2022. The campaign amplified the voices of rural Alberta leading up to the the 2023 provincial election.

A <a href="https://rmalberta.com/uniquely-rural/" target="_blank">platform page</a> hosted the videos and additional resources the RMA had available and it also leveraged the 2023 Spring Convention to maximize exposure and showcase the campaign to RMA members.

After the election, due to positive feedback, the Uniquely Rural campaign continued on as rural members were keen to share their stories and successes.

All of the videos are available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPQZuP3ArX4&list=PLOwQD01wk7sBxRzpIZyuE3VpcllpzEKDh" target="_blank">Uniquely Rural playlist</a> on the RMA's YouTube channel.

The campaign was a group effort that included contributions from the Advocacy and Marketing & Communications team at the RMA, including including <a href="http://brandonlow.com/" target="_blank">Brandon Low</a>.
