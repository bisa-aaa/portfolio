CCI Thermal Technologies Inc. was an industrial heating and filtration manufacturing company based in Canada with several locations in the US. During my tenure as the in-house designer, I was given the opportunity to redesign and maintain all of the brochures, catalogues, and manuals across six different brands of products.

The design and development of the marketing materials and publications required collaboration with other departments, primarily engineering, sales, and production. As CCI Thermal's products were regulated and certified for industry standards and safety, precision and accuracy was paramount. I worked with the engineering and production departments to capture product and instructional photos.

With CCI Thermal's unique manufacturing capabilities and integration with production, relying on in-house experts, I was able to design a tradeshow booth that met the shipping criteria, different tradeshow venue restrictions, as well as ease of setup and takedown for sales staff. This one-of-a-kind tradeshow booth can be assembled to be 10x20 ft or 10x10 ft. Its graphic panels were designed to be interchangeable and can be assembled in different ways, allowing for flexibility. The black powder-coated booth legs are laser-cut with all six brand names and are lined with red LED lights!
