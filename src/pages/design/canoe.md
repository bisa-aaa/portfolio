In June 2021, RMA Trade was rebranded and launched as the Canoe Procurement Group of Canada. Canoe originally began in Alberta in 1936 when municipalities combined their purchasing power. A rebrand was naturally needed as it had grown, flourished, and expanded across Canada since.

The images included are a direct reflection of my involvement with the launch and establishing of Canoe brand early on.

With the launch of Canoe, I worked on various components such as the design of the <a href="https://canoeprocurement.ca" target="_blank">website</a>, business cards, and various documents that were distributed to suppliers and members.

A major component of the website involves a <a href="https://canoeprocurement.ca/programs/" target="_blank">program</a> and <a href="https://canoeprocurement.ca/suppliers/directory/" target="_blank">supplier</a> directory. Previously, the directory was printed annual and became out of date quickly due to changes in suppliers and addition of programs throughout the year. The directory also doubles as a resource for client relations managers during client visits.

The rebrand and launch was a team effort of the Marketing & Communications team, including <a href="http://brandonlow.com/" target="_blank">Brandon Low</a>, at the RMA.
