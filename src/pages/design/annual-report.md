The Rural Municipalities of Alberta's (RMA) annual report includes a selection of digitally painted illustrations that feature the RMA building on the cover each year. For 2020 - 2021 in particular, the report's interior includes a selection of digitally illustrated rural Alberta landscapes throughout completed by me.

The annual report is an in-depth document that highlights the RMA's year in review across all of its divisions and departments throughout the fiscal year August 2020 - July 2021.

The full report is available <a href="https://rmalberta.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-Annual-Report-web.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
